      # Returns an indicator of where the specified point (px,py) lies with respect to the line segment from
      # (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
      #
      # The return value can be either 1, -1, or 0 and indicates in which direction the specified line must pivot around its first end point, (x1,y1), in order to point at the specified point (px,py).
      # A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise.
      #
      # A return value of -1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this direction is clockwise.
      #
      # A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value of 0 is rare and not useful for determining collinearity because of floating point rounding issues.
      #
      # If the point is colinear with the line segment, but not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point lies “beyond (x1,y1)” or 1 if the point lies “beyond (x2,y2)”.
