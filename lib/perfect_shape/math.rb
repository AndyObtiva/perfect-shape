      # Computes the remainder operation on two arguments as prescribed by the IEEE 754 standard. The remainder value is mathematically equal to x - p Ã— n, where n is the mathematical integer closest to the exact mathematical value of the quotient x/p, and if two mathematical integers are equally close to x/p, then n is the integer that is even. If the remainder is zero, its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument. Special cases:
      # If either argument is NaN, or the first argument is infinite, or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is NaN.
      # If the first argument is finite and the second argument is infinite, then the result is the same as the first argument.
      # Parameters:
      # x - the dividend.
      # p - the divisor.
      # Returns:
      # the remainder when x is divided by p.
