- Consider the idea of having tests run in JRuby and check against java.awt.geom first and then compare result with perfect-shape
- Document in gemspec what this library supports (e.g. IEEEremainder once it supports it)
- Consider contributing IEEEremainder to Ruby
- Contribute this type of expectation: _(arc).must_be :contain?, *point to Minitest Expectations
